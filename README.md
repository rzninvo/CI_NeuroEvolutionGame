# CI_NeuroEvolutionGame
Computational Intelligence Final Project
This game has been developed as an assignment for students at Amirkabir University of Technology to apply neuroevolution using a simple game called Snail Jumper.

A game featuring a snail protagonist that can be played manually or using a Neuro Evolution
algorithm. The snail navigates through obstacles to earn points, with a neural network guiding its
actions. There are 300 randomly initialized ”actors” (i.e., snails with neural networks), and only the
fittest ones were evolved and mutated into the next generation. The hyperparameters were carefully
selected to optimize the scoring system. I also experimented with various methods for selecting the
next population, including K fittest, Roulette Wheel, SUS, and Q-Tournament
